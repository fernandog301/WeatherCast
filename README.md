what I did: to start off I made a weather app using api calls, functions, and async with java calls. My goal was to make a functional weather call and making my app look as similar to the figma

peer review desc: Figma looks similar to website. The weather website is functioning including after searching city in the search bar, it populates the 5 day forecast, the high and low temp for each day, weather icons which changes on search, the description of current day forecast. When you search a city and click the favorite icon, it populates the cities in the action dropdown menu. However, when you choose a city in the dropdown menu, it does not populate that city. Also, the current time does show up on the website. The website looks great, simple to navigate, and is user friendly.
